\chapter{Open Issues}
In recent years, there have been an excessive number of contributions related to security in vehicular networks.Most of these researches were 
based on different techniques designed to improve security and protect communicating members against a number of potential attacks. An effective 
security mechanism should be able to handle threats targeting the availability, the confidentiality and the authenticity of data in regards to 
communication between vehicles and infrastructures in a VANET enabled environment. Indeed most security mechanisms available for VANET do not 
combine Efficiency, Security and Traceability. They tend to score well in their provision of one or two qualities, but not all three because of 
the potential contradictions between some of their properties, therefore Effective Security is still an ill-defined problem. Security plays an 
essential role in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks and in the absence of an effective security mechanism, malicious parties could inject bogus information
within the network, causing serious accidents.

Secure data communication is a well-researched area in Information Technology, despite the significant volume of devastating attacks that still 
occur. VANET technologies pose different security threats and requirements therefore create a new research challenge preventing the use of existing 
network security solutions.

The important issue with the security is the authentication and integrity. Privacy is not important since the propagated information is not relevant 
for attackers. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Authentication: This service is concerned with assuring that the origin of a message is correctly identified. Vehicles reactions to events 
should be based on legitimate messages. This attribute is the core security requirement in VANET.The identity of the nodes in the network must be 
ensured. Otherwise, it would be possible for an attacker to masquerade a legitimate node in order to send and receive messages on its behalf.
Authentication is a must in order to achieve the necessary trust in vehicular ad hoc networks. The existence of an authentication service makes 
it more difficult for attackers to join the network in the first place and thus increases the cost of misbehaviour. Hence, by verifying the authenticity
of any node before exchanging information, mobile nodes reduce the amount of undesired data\cite{gill}.

\item Integrity: This service assures that system assets and information transmitted over the network cannot be altered by unauthorised parties. 
Indeed these modifications may include writing, deleting or changing the status of transmitted messages i.e. messages sent over the network should
not be corrupted. Possible attacks that would compromise their integrity are malicious attacks or signal failures producing errors in the transmission\cite{sp}.
