natbib.sty - The natbib package defines a number of very useful citation commands which replace the usual \cite. These are really necessary in any author-year citation system, where you don't always cite a reference using the same format for the citation. These commands and their output are illustrated below. The most frequently used are \citet (textual cite) and \citep (parenthetical cite). \cite is equivalent to \citet, but this shouldn't be used because it is often defined by other style files.

watermark.sty - In order to have a watermark sentence (e.g. "SAMPLE COPY ONLY"), use the draftcopy package, with the additional parameters

chapter1.tex to chapter6.tex - are the Chapters of the Thesis.
