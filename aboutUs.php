                    <p><span style="font-size:20px">Smile is a one-stop resource for donations. Through this online platform we seek to popularise the concept of donating for humanity. While monetary donations can be made by people with financial means, donating in kind can be done by practically everyone because item being donated is already in use with us.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-size:20px">Hereby we have started-off by providing information on donation seekers so that donors can straightaway contact the NGO's which will receive this donations and will provide to the needy. Through this site you can reach a government certified NGO in the city of Indore. However, in due course, we wish to move upwards on the value chain by organizing our own collection centres in major Indian cities, followed by distribution to deserving establishments.</span></p>
