We are proposing an algorithm to count nodes round a specific position using wireless technology. 
These types of algorithms have interested the research community for a long time since they can be used in many 
applications. During the development of this project some ideas surged to understand better and improve the
obtained results. Some of these ideas have been used, but due to the limited duration of this project it
has not been possible to incorporate all of them.

Some of these ideas may constitute future research lines:

\begin{itemize}

 \item Enhance the algorithm to take advantage of the 7 channels of WAVE (6 channels because the middle channel is 
 reserved for security).
 \item Evaluate the performance of the algorithm with authentication and integrity embedded in~it.
\end{itemize}
