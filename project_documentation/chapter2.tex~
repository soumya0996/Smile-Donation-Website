\chapter{Technologies for Vehicular Environment}
Emerging Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are representing the preferred network design for Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITSs), mainly based on Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) for Vehicle-to-Vehicle 
(V2V) communications. Future vehicles will be fully networked, equipped with on-board computers with multiple Network Interface Cards (NICs) for 
well-deployed wireless technologies (e.g., WiFi, HSDPA) and emerging wireless technologies (e.g., WAVE, WiMaX, LTE).
\section{DSRC}
The main benefit of vehicular communication is seen in active safety systems that increase passenger
safety by exchanging warning messages between vehicles. Other applications and private services are also
used in order to lower the cost and to encourage vehicular network deployment and adoption. The allocation
of 75 MHz in the 5.9 GHz frequency band licensed for Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), 
which supports seven separate channels, may also enable the future delivery of rich multimedia contents
to vehicles at short to medium range via vehicular communications. To effectively use limited wireless 
spectrum and DSRC channels allocated to vehicular communications, and to provision Quality-of-Service (QoS)
for different vehicular network applications, Medium Access Control (MAC) is one of the major challenges.

In a vehicular network, each vehicle is equipped with the technology that allows the vehicle to communicate
with others, as well as with the roadside infrastructure, for example, base stations also known as Road-Side
Units (RSUs) located in some critical sections of the road such as traffic lights, intersections, or
stop signs to improve the driving experience and make driving safer. By using such communication 
devices, also known as On-Board Units (OBUs), vehicles can communicate with each other as well as with 
RSUs. A vehicular network is a self-organized network that enables communications between vehicles and
RSUs, and the RSUs can be connected to a backbone network, so that many other network applications and 
services, including Internet access, can be provided to the vehicles. Figure~\ref{fig2.1} shows an example of a vehicular network.

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently allocated 75 MHz of DSRC spectrum at 5.9 GHz to 
be used exclusively for V2V and V2R communications the primary purpose is to enable public safety applications 
that save lives and improve vehicular traffic flow. Private services are also permitted to lower the network 
deployment and maintenance costs to encourage DSRC development and adoption. The DSRC spectrum is divided into 
seven 10-MHz wide channels, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig2.2} Channel 178 is the control channel, which is generally restricted 
to safety communications only. The two channels at the edges of the spectrum are reserved for future advanced
accident avoidance applications and high-power public safety communication usages. The rest are service channels
and are available for both safety and non-safety applications.

\subsection{DSRC Applications}
There are eight groups identified as DSRC-based ITS applications including:
\begin{enumerate}  
\itemsep0em
  \item Travel and traffic management
  \item Maintenance and construction operations
  \item Public transit management
  \item Electronic payment
  \item Commercial vehicle operations
  \item Emergency management
  \item Advanced vehicle safety systems
  \item Information management
\end{enumerate}

These applications also be categorized based on public or private used radio, based on different range (less
than 15, 15–100, 100–400, and 400–1000 m), based on vehicle type (all vehicles, buses, trains, heavy trucks, 
and emergency vehicles), or based on safety measures (public safety, private safety,
warnings, and commercial applications).

Examples within these groups include electronic toll collection, transit vehicle signal priority,
fuel payment, parking payment, electronic commerce, traffic information, management of public
transportation and commercial vehicles, fleet management, work zone warning, road condition
warning, weather information, and border crossing clearance etc.

Currently, public safety applications are the focal point for governments and government driven
researches. Car manufacturers are more focused on applications enhancing driver experience
in-vehicle applications like safe lane change, and driver-vehicle-road interaction.The highway electronics
industry is focused on other issues like toll collection, parking management, and processing
of electronic payment. The Vehicular Infrastructure Integration (VII) is a consortium of different
interest groups focused on the interoperability of DSRC and non-DSRC applications.
\section{IEEE 802.11p}
For V2X communications, it is inevitable that all participating parties agree on a common standard. 
Currently standard for this specific type of communication is IEEE 802.11p which was approved on 
July 2011. Basically it is one amendment within the family of IEEE 802.11 (IEEE 2007) standards that define the
widely used technology for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). IEEE 802.11p is adapted to the specifics that have 
to be respected in V2X communications.

IEEE 802.11p is a variant of IEEE 802.11a that additionally covers the specifics of V2X communication, highly dynamic
and mobile environment, message transmission in an ad-hoc manner, low latency, and operation in a reserved frequency 
range. These specifics require several adaptations to the standard. Historically, the IEEE 802.11p standard evolved out 
of the ‘ASTM E2213-03 Standard Specification for Telecommunications and Information Exchange between Roadside and Vehicle
Systems’ (ASTM 2003) that was transformed into an IEEE compliant style in 2004. In the following years standardization 
discussion continued, and the first version that successfully passed the IEEE 802 working group letter ballot was draft 
version 4.0 In July 2010, Amendment 6 is proposed for IEEE 802.11p. Thus, IEEE 802.11p standardized on July 2011.
\section{IEEE 1609.1, IEEE 1609.2, IEEE 1609.3, and IEEE 1609.4}
For V2X communication, the IEEE 1609 trial-use standards are developed providing the necessary 
services on a higher layer within the payload of IEEE 802.11p frames; a short overview is given here:
\begin{itemize}
 \item IEEE 1609.1 defines a resource manager that should allow multiple applications run on RSUs to 
 communicate with the OBUs of multiple vehicles. It serves on the application layer.
 \item IEEE 1609.2 defines security services for the V2X communication, such as authentication of stations and 
 encryption of messages.
 \item IEEE 1609.3 specifies networking services for V2X communication, including a specific stack and protocol 
 to handle WAVE Short Messages (WSMs).
 \item IEEE 1609.4 defines how the operation of multiple channels is organized and has a strong relation to the 
 Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanisms.
