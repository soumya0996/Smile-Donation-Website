\chapter{Simulation Tools for Vehicular Environment}
Wireless communication technologies have now greatly impact our daily lives from indoor wireless LANs to outdoor
cellular mobile networks. Wireless technologies have benefited billions of users around the globe. The era of 
Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) is now evolving, gaining attention and momentum. Researchers and developers
have built VANET simulation software to allow the study and evaluation of various media access, routing, and emergency
warning protocols. VANET simulation is fundamentally different from MANETs (Mobile Ad-hoc Networks) simulation because
in VANETs, vehicular environment imposes new issues and requirements, such as constrained road topology, multi-path 
fading and roadside obstacles, traffic flow models, trip models, varying vehicular speed and mobility, traffic lights, 
traffic congestion, drivers’ behavior, etc. Currently, there are VANET mobility generators, network simulators, and 
VANET simulators. There are several comparisons of the various publicly available VANET simulation software and 
their components. In particular, the differences are their software characteristics, Graphical User Interface (GUI), 
popularity, ease of use, input requirements, output visualization capability, accuracy of simulation, etc. Finally, 
while each of the studied simulators provides a good simulation environment for VANETs, refinements and further 
contributions are needed before they can be widely used by the research community.

In the following sections, a brief description of possible network simulation tools 
(OMNeT++/INETMANET, ns-3, NCTUns, JiST/SWANS)
and possible traffic simulators (SUMO, VanetMobiSim) is given.
\section{OMNeT++/INETMANET}
\justifying
OMNeT++\cite{omnetpp} is an extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library and framework, primarily for building network 
simulators. ``Network'' is meant in a broader sense that includes wired and wireless communication networks, on-chip networks,
queuing networks, and so on. Domain-specific functionality such as support for sensor networks, wireless ad-hoc networks, 
Internet protocols, performance modeling, photonic networks, etc., is provided by model frameworks, developed as independent
projects. OMNeT++ offers an Eclipse-based IDE, a graphical run-time environment, and plug-ins. There are 
extensions for real-time simulation, network emulation, alternative programming languages (Java, C\#), database integration,
SystemC integration, and several other functions. OMNeT++ is free for academic and non-profit use, and it is a widely used 
platform in the global scientific community, commercial users must obtain license from appropriate authority. OMNEST is the 
commercial version of OMNeT++, offered by Simulcraft Inc.

The INET Framework is an open-source communication networks simulation package for the OMNeT++ simulation environment.
It contains models for several wired and wireless networking protocols, including UDP, TCP, SCTP, IP, IPv6, Ethernet, 
PPP, 802.11, MPLS, OSPF, and many others.

INETMANET is based on INET Framework for OMNEST/OMNeT++ 4.x and continuously developed. Generally it provides the same 
functionality as the INET Framework, but contains additional protocols and components that are especially useful while
modeling wireless communication such as:
 
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
 \item Propagation models
 \item Link layer protocols
 \item Mobile routing protocols (AODV, DSR, DSDV, BATMAN, DYMO, and OLSR)
 \item Mobility models
 \item Application models
 \item Other modules and changes
\end{itemize}
\section{ns-3}
ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems, targeted primarily for research and educational use.
ns-3 is free software, licensed under the GNU GPLv2 license, and is publicly available for research, development, and use.
The goal of the ns-3 project is to develop a preferred, open simulation environment for networking research. It should
be aligned with the simulation needs of modern networking research and should encourage community contribution, peer 
review, and validation of the software. The ns-3 project is committed to building a solid simulation core that is well
documented, easy to use and debug, 
and that caters to the needs of the entire simulation work-flow, from simulation configuration to trace collection 
and analysis.
Furthermore, the ns-3 software infrastructure encourages the development of simulation models which are sufficiently 
realistic to allow ns-3 to be used as a real-time network emulator, interconnected with the real world and which allows
many existing real-world protocol implementations to be reused within ns-3.

The ns-3 simulation core supports research on both IP and non-IP based networks. However, the large majority of its users 
focused on wireless/IP simulations which involve models for WiFi, WiMaX, or LTE for layers 1 and 2 and a variety of static
or dynamic routing protocols such as OLSR and AODV for IP-based applications.
ns-3 also supports a real-time scheduler that facilitates a number of ``simulation-in-the-loop'' use cases for interacting
with real systems. For instance, users can emit and receive ns-3 generated packets on real network devices, and ns-3 can
serve as an interconnection framework to add link effects between virtual machines.
Another emphasis of the simulator is on the reuse of real application and kernel code. Frameworks for running unmodified 
applications or the entire Linux kernel networking stack within ns-3 are presently being tested and evaluated. Latest 
version ns-3.15 was released on August 2012.
\section{NCTUns}
NCTUns stands for National Chiao Tung University Network Simulator, a network simulator and emulator.
It was open-source software running on Linux, Fedora 12, with an integrated GUI environment.

NCTUns provide several advantages in front of other network simulators:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item 	Realistic network traffic can be generated by realistic life applications to generate more realistic simulation results.
\item The performance of any real-life application can be easily evaluated on NCTUns under various simulated network conditions.
\item Any network application program developed for NCTUns device can be directly run up on a real-life Linux device without any modification.
\item In its 6.0 release, the simulator provides a complete implementation of the emergent IEEE 802.11p and 1609. X standards for wireless vehicular networks.
\item It also exists a commercial version of NCTUns, named EstiNet Network Simulator and Emulator, defined as 
``a software tool for network planning, testing, education, protocol development, and applications performance prediction.
It is both a network simulator and emulator with worldwide customers and global impact.''
\end{itemize}
NCTUns simulates Ethernet-based IP networks with fixed nodes and Point-to-Point links. It simulates IEEE 802.11a/b,
wireless LAN networks, including both the ad-hoc and infrastructure modes. It simulates GPRS cellular networks, 
optical networks, including traditional circuit switching optical network and more advanced Optical Burst Switching 
(OBS) networks.

NCTUns can simulate:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
 \item IEEE 802.11b wireless mesh networks
 \item IEEE 802.11e QoS networks, tactical and active mobile ad hoc networks, and wireless networks with directional and steerable antennas.
 \item 802.16d WiMaX networks, including the PMP and mesh modes.
 \item 802.16e mobile WiMaX PMP networks.
 \item 802.16j transparent mode and non-transparent mode relay WiMaX networks.
 \item DVB-RCS satellite networks for a GEO satellite located 36,000 km above the earth.
 \item 802.11p/1609.X vehicular networks, which is an amendment to the 802.11-2007 standard for highly mobile environment. Over this platform, one can easily develop and evaluate 
 advanced V2V and V2I applications in the ITS research field.
\end{itemize}
It simulates multi-interface mobile nodes equipped with multiple heterogeneous wireless interfaces. This type of mobile 
nodes will become common and play an important role in the real life, because they can choose the most cost-effective 
network to connect to the Internet at any time and at any location.

\section{JiST/SWANS}
Discrete-event simulators are important scientific tools and the focus of a vast body of computer science research that 
is directed at their efficient design and execution. The JiST system, which stands for ``Java in Simulation Time'', follows
a long line of simulation frameworks, languages and systems. JiST is a new Java-based discrete-event simulation engine
with a number of novel and unique design features. 
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
 \item Entity invocation tracking time:
No context switching; zero-copy; cross-layer optimizations;
type-safety; implicit event structures and types
 \item  Timeless objects packets:
Saves memory; simplifies memory management
 \item  Proxy entities network stack:
Restricts communication pattern; simplifies development
 \item  Reflection script-based configuration:
No memory or performance hit; no additional code
 \item  Continuations socket implementations:
Run standard Java network applications over simulated network
\end{itemize}

SWANS is a ``Scalable Wireless Ad hoc Network Simulator''  built atop the JiST platform. It was created primarily because existing
network simulation tools are not sufficient for current research needs, and its performance serves as a validation of 
the virtual machine-based approach to simulator construction. SWANS is organized as independent software components
that can be composed to form complete wireless network or sensor network configurations. Its capabilities are similar 
to ns-2 and GloMoSim, but are able to simulate much larger networks. SWANS leverages the JiST design to achieve high 
simulation throughput, save memory, and run standard Java network applications over simulated networks. In addition, 
SWANS implements a data structure, called hierarchical binning, for efficient computation of signal propagation.
 
\section{SUMO}
``Simulation of Urban MObility'' or ``SUMO'' for short, is a microscopic road traffic simulation. The work on SUMO's
design began in the year 2000, with the first implementation being started in the year 2001. In the beginning, 
SUMO was developed in collaboration between the Center for Applied Informatics Cologne (ZAIK) and the Institute 
of Transportation Systems (ITS), at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Since 2004, the work on SUMO is continued at
the DLR only, though with contribution from external organizations or individuals. SUMO is available as ``open source''
under the GNU General Public License, both as source code and in compiled, executable form for multiple Windows 
and Linux platforms. The reason for building an open-source traffic simulation was twofold. While working on traffic
simulations within the academic field, it was noted that many different, small simulations were developed as tools within
diploma or doctoral theses, in order to evaluate the objective that was the thesis’ real topic. Often, these simulations
were incomplete due to the large amount of problems that must be solved for having a complete traffic simulation, and after
the thesis was completed, the used simulations were not made available to the public and they disappeared. So on the one hand, 
the work to be done to have a proper traffic scenario being simulated was repeatedly redone, wasting resources and distracting
from the actual topic of interest. On the other hand, the results of such scientific work are hardly comparable as long 
as the simulations used to evaluate them have different features, use different (sub-) models and implementation details.
Because one of the main research areas of the Institute of Transportation Systems was to compare and evaluate different 
models and algorithms related to traffic and traffic management, the idea was created to develop a free, extensible
traffic simulation, so that:\\
(a) Different people may use it as a base test bed for their own applications and \\
(b) These applications would get more comparable.

This idea and the academic context SUMO is developed within highly influenced design criteria and SUMO’s features.
As main design criteria, the following were stated:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item 	Portability: The simulation must run on any common environment, because many research organizations were using
Linux or, at the time the work on SUMO started, Solaris as operating system.
\item Extensibility: The simulation must be open and easy to understand, so that someone who has not contributed
to the original development can adapt it fast to his or her own needs.
\end{itemize}

\section{VanetMobiSim}
VanetMobiSim is an extension for the CANU Mobility Simulation Environment (CanuMobiSim), a flexible framework for user
mobility modeling. CanuMobiSim is Java-based and can generate movement traces in different formats, supporting different
simulation/emulation tools for mobile networks (ns-2, GloMoSim, QualNet, NET). CanuMobiSim originally includes parsers 
for maps in the Geographical Data Files (GDF) standard and provides implementations of several random mobility models
as well as models from physics and vehicular dynamics. VanetMobiSim is capable of producing realistic vehicular mobility 
traces for several network simulators.

The VanetMobiSim extension focuses on vehicular mobility, and features new realistic automotive motion models at both
macroscopic and microscopic levels. At macroscopic level, VanetMobiSim can import maps from the US Census Bureau
TIGER/Line database, or randomly generate them using Voronoi tessellation. Also, it adds support for multi-lane roads,
separate directional flows, differentiated speed constraints and traffic signs at intersections. At microscopic level, 
VanetMobiSim implements new mobility models, providing realistic C2C and C2I interaction. According to these models, 
vehicles regulate their speed depending on nearby cars, overtake each other and act according to traffic signs in 
presence of intersections. VanetMobiSim mobility patterns have been validated against TSIS-CORSIM - a well-known and 
validated traffic generator - proving the high level of realism reached by VanetMobiSim.
