\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textbf{M.Tech Dissertation Research Orientation}} 
IEEE LTSA framework has been able to genrate interest for implementation of e-Learning technology meant for two-tier or three tier.
 Such e-Learning framework lacks security aspect making it insufficient for web educational services through Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Implementation of different security services at different
layers requires a pragmatic mapping from client-server architecture to distributed system architecture and finally to Service Oriented Architecture.
