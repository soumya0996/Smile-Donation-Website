To carry out the dissertation work I have gone through related scientific papers which are:

\item In [1], authors present a novel VANET-based approach to obtain the position of the last vehicle and the number of 
vehicles, in a line of vehicles stopped at a traffic light. They also show that the algorithm to estimate the position 
of the last vehicle will still function even if just a few vehicles are equipped with VANET technology 
(low penetration rate), which is important since it will take years for all vehicles to be equipped with WAVE technology.
 \item In [2], authors propose a new video analysis method for counting vehicles, where they used an adaptive bounding 
 box size to detect and track vehicles according to their estimated distance from the camera given the scene-camera geometry. 

 \item In [3], the background subtraction and image segmentation, based on morphological transformation, 
 is proposed for tracking and counting vehicles on highways. The proposed algorithm uses erosion followed by dilation
 on various frames.
 \item In [4], the authors intends to develop a vehicle detection and counting system using image processing. 
 Overall works are software development of a system that requires a video stream and capture to a video frame.
 \item Reference [5] presents a video-based solution for real time vehicle detection and counting system, using a 
 surveillance camera mounted on a relatively high place to acquire the traffic video stream. The two main methods
 applied in this system are: the adaptive background estimation and the Gaussian shadow elimination.

 \item In [6], the authors proposed a sensor system for traffic data acquisition. The embedded system, comprising a 
 motion-sensitive optical sensor and a low-cost, low-power DSP, is capable of detecting, counting and measuring the 
 velocity of passing vehicles. The detection is based on monitoring of the optical sensor output within configurable 
 regions of interest in the sensor's field-of-view.
